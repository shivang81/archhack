# archhack - Parkinsons Detection Tool

What Is This?
-------------
This is an application that is used to detect Parkinson's disease in its early stage. We use a symptom that there are tremors in the limbs of the patient. We collected the 3-D coordinates of the tremors along with the acceleration and speed via an accelerometer on an android smartphone.
We are using neural networks based with 500 input layer size and 25 hidden layers with two output layers prediction 1 or 2. 1 being positive for Parkinsons and 2 being negetive.
This application was made in 1.5 days during ArchHacks 2016.

How To Use This
---------------

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
2. Run `python app.py`. This starts the server. 
3. Install and run the mobile app to detect the disease.
